FydeOS is committed to adapting and compatible with more hardware devices and external devices. Due to the particularity of the Chromium OS system structure, FydeOS is currently less compatible with hardware devices that are not mainstream, do not provide mainline Linux kernel drivers, and do not support mainstream Linux distributions.

"A device" here may include but is not limited to:
 - Wireless network card
 - Ethernet card
 - Sound
 - Printer
 - Automatic identification of headphone jack
 - Touchpad
 - Touch screen
 - Stylus
 - Fingerprint reader
 - Camera
 - Gravity sensor module
 - Battery remaining display
 - Power management strategy
 - Other unique external devices

If you find that your "a device" cannot be recognized on FydeOS and the function is missing, you can try to run [Ubuntu Desktop](https://cn.ubuntu.com/desktop/) on your device to detect the device Compatibility with Linux systems. If it appears to be recognized under Ubuntu and can work normally but fails under FydeOS, welcome to our [Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) to post for help and provide detailed hardware information to help Our development team further improves hardware compatibility.
