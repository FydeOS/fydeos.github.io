In the FydeOS for PC version, you can use the username `chronos` to log in to the system's command line (shell) environment. The account does not set a password by default. In addition, the account can also use the `sudo` command to escalate rights.

For security reasons, we recommend that you change the password as soon as possible.

For how to change the password of FydeOS, please refer to [this knowledge base document](/en/recipes/chronos-password/).
